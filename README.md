# Using CSS Frameworks

Frameworks let you focus more on building great solutions and less on how they are actually coded up on the front end. In this project, I used Twitterâ€™s Bootstrap framework to design the homepage of the NewsWeek website [Here](https://www.newsweek.com/# "NewsWeek Home Page").
This project was completed for demonstration purposes only; in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
