# Displaying and Inputting Data

Frameworks let you focus more on building great solutions and less on how they are actually coded up on the front end. In this project, I used Twitter’s Bootstrap framework to design the homepage of the NewsWeek website [Here](https://www.newsweek.com/# "NewsWeek Home Page").
